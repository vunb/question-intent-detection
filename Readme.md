Dependencies:NLTK,RE,tensorflow,theano,scikit,pandas

Run : python pos.py 

1.This repository consists of codes for question detection in three ways:

1. Rule based grammar: `python pos.py`
2. Naive bayes: `python nb.py`
3. Neural network

a) This code take care of preprocessing,labelling/padding,vocabulary building  of data set  
* python corpus_handle.py

b) Training the model 
* python train_model.py

c) Testing the model  
* python test_model.py
